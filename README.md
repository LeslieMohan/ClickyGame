# Clicky Game

This is a memory game created using REACT.  The app renders images which the user will click on to obtain points and keeps track of the user's score. The user's score increases when clicking an image for the first time. The user's score will reset to 0 if they click the same image more than once.  Everytime a user clicks on an image, the images will shuffle their order.  After an incorrect guess, the game will restart and score set to 0.
